The sandglass conjecture, posed by Simonyi, states that if a pair $(\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{B})$ of families of subsets of $[n]$ is recovering then $|\\mathcal{A}| |\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2^n$.
We improve the best known upper bound to $|\\mathcal{A}| |\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2.2543^n$.
To do this we overcome a significant barrier by exponentially separating the upper bounds on recovering pairs from cancellative pairs, a related notion.

A multigraph $G$ is said to be an $(s,q)$-graph if every $s$-set of vertices in $G$ supports at most $q$ edges (counting multiplicities).

Erdős conjectured in 1945 that for any unit vectors $v_1, \\dotsc, v_n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and signs $\\varepsilon_1, \\dotsc, \\varepsilon_n$ taken independently and uniformly in $\\{-1,1\\}$, the random Rademacher sum $\\sigma = \\varepsilon_1 v_1 + \\dotsb + \\varepsilon_n v_n$ satisfies $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq 1$  with probability $\\Omega(1/n)$.
While this conjecture is false for even $n$, Beck has proved that $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq \\sqrt{2}$ always holds with probability $\\Omega(1/n)$.
Recently, He, Juškevičius, Narayanan, and Spiro conjectured that the Erdős' conjecture holds when $n$ is odd.
We disprove this conjecture by exhibiting vectors $v_1, \\dotsc, v_n$ for which $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq 1$ occurs with probability $O(1/n^{3/2})$.
On the other hand, an approximated version of their conjecture holds: we show that we always have $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq 1 + \\delta$ with probability $\\Omega_\\delta(1/n)$, for all $\\delta > 0$.
This shows that when $n$ is odd, the minimum probability that $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq r$ exhibits a double-jump phase transition at $r = 1$, as we can also show that $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq 1$ occurs with probability at least $\\Omega((1/2+\\mu)^n)$ for some $\\mu > 0$.
Additionally, and using a different construction, we give a negative answer to a question of Beck and two other questions of He, Juškevičius, Narayanan, and Spiro, concerning the optimal constructions minimising the probability that $\\|\\sigma\\|_2 \\leq \\sqrt{2}$.
We also make some progress on the higher dimensional versions of these questions.

The $(m,b)$ Maker-Breaker percolation game on $(\\mathbb{Z}^2)_p$, introduced by Day and Falgas-Ravry, is played in the following way.
Before the game starts, each edge of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is removed independently with probability $1-p$.
After that, Maker chooses a vertex $v_0$ to protect.
Then, in each round Maker and Breaker claim respectively $m$ and $b$ unclaimed edges of $G$.
Breaker wins if after the removal of the edges claimed by him the component of $v_0$ becomes finite, and Maker wins if she can indefinitely prevent Breaker from winning. <br><br>

We show that for any $p < 1$, Breaker almost surely has a winning strategy for the $(1,1)$ game on $(\\mathbb{Z}^2)_p$.
This fully answers a question of Day and Falgas-Ravry, who showed that for $p = 1$ Maker has a winning strategy for the $(1,1)$ game.
Further, we show that in the $(2,1)$ game on $(\\mathbb{Z}^2)_p$ Maker almost surely has a winning strategy whenever $p > 0.9402$, while Breaker almost surely has a winning strategy whenever $p < 0.5278$.
This shows that the threshold value of $p$ above which Maker has a winning strategy for the $(2,1)$ game on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is non-trivial.
In fact, we prove similar results in various settings, including other lattices and biases $(m,b)$. <br><br>

These results extend also to the most general case, which we introduce, where each edge is given to Maker with probability $\\alpha$ and to Breaker with probability $\\beta$ before the game starts.

The Kuramoto model is a prototypical model used for rigorous mathematical analysis in the field of synchronisation and nonlinear dynamics.
A realisation of this model consists of a collection of identical oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph.
In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that the Kuramoto model on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronised state with all the oscillators with same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero.
In particular, we show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$ and $p \\geq (1 + \\varepsilon)(\\log n)/n$, the Kuramoto model on the Erdős-Rényi graph $G(n,p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity.
This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu and Bandeira.
We also show that the Kuramoto model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph with $d \\geq 600$ and that, for the same range of degrees, a $d$-regular random graph is typically globally synchronizing.

Let $\\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group and let $G$ be a graph.
The zero-sum Ramsey number $R(G, \\Gamma)$ is the least integer $N$ (if it exists) such that, for every edge-colouring $E(K_N) \\mapsto \\Gamma$, one can find a copy $G \\subseteq K_N$ where the sum of the colours of the edges of $G$ is zero. <br><br>

A large body of research on this problem has emerged in the past few decades, paying special attention to the case where $\\Gamma$ is cyclic. In this work, we start a systematic study of $R(G, \\Gamma)$ for groups $\\Gamma$ of small exponent, in particular, $\\Gamma = \\mathbb{Z}_2^d$. For the Klein group $\\mathbb{Z}_2^2$, the smallest non-cyclic abelian group, we compute $R(G, \\mathbb{Z}_2^2)$ for all odd forests $G$ and show that $R(G, \\mathbb{Z}_2^2) \\leq n+2$ for all forests $G$ on at least $6$ vertices. We also show that $R(C_4, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d) = 2^d + 1$ for any $d \\geq 2$, and determine the order of magnitude of $R(K_{t,r}, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d)$ as $d \\to \\infty$ for all $t, r$. <br><br>

We also consider the related setting where the ambient graph $K_N$ is substituted by the complete bipartite graph $K_{N,N}$. Denote the analogue bipartite zero-sum Ramsey number by $B(G, \\Gamma)$. We show that $B(C_4, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d) = 2^d + 1$ for all $d \\geq 1$ and $B(\\{C_4, C_6\\}, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d) = 2^{d/2} + 1$ for all even $d \\geq 2$. Additionally, we show that $B(K_{t,r}, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d)$ and $R(K_{t,r}, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d)$ have the same asymptotic behaviour as $d \\to \\infty$, for all $t, r$. Finally, we conjecture the value of $B(\\{C_4, \\dotsc, C_{2m}\\}, \\mathbb{Z}_2^d)$ and provide the corresponding lower bound.

In this work, we study hitting times for the appearance of a spanning structure in the Erdős-Rényi random directed graph processes. Namely, we are concerned with the appearance of an arborescence, a spanning digraph in which, for a vertex $u$ called the root and any other vertex $v$, there is exactly one directed path from $u$ to $v$. Let $\\mathcal{D}(n,0)$, $\\mathcal{D}(n,1)$, $\\dotsc$, $\\mathcal{D}(n,n(n-1))$ be the random digraph process where for every $m \\in \\{0, \\dotsc, n(n-1)\\}$, $\\mathcal{D}(n,m)$ is a digraph with vertex set $\\{1, \\dotsc, n\\}$; $\\mathcal{D}(n,0)$ has no arcs and, for $1 \\leq m \\leq n(n-1)$, the digraph $\\mathcal{D}(n,m)$ is obtained by adding an arc to $\\mathcal{D}(n,m-1)$, chosen uniformly at random among the not present arcs. In this paper we determine the hitting time for the existence of $k$ arc-disjoint arborescences when $k=  k(n) \\ll \\sqrt{\\log n}$.
